2ch Tablet Browser

Nibura, as in 2ch (Ni Chaneru) Browser (BURAuza),
is meant to be an Android tablet application for viewing 2ch style message boards.

STATUS: Currently the backend for parsing and data logic storage is being developed. The Android GUI will be developed later as it'll only make a handful of calls to the backend. This makes it easier to potentially move to iOS in the future if there is demand for it.

There will be support for phones, but for now the focus is on building the backend and making the GUI for tablets.

Project Learning Goals:
Build using TDD/BDD principals for driving code changes.
