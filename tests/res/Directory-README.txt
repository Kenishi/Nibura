2CH_TEST_MENU.html
	This is a small legitimate list from 2ch, used to check that the app can properly process the 2ch site html.
	Note: The file is encoded in UTF-8 while the 2ch site is encoded in S-JIS. UTF-8 is used because Eclipse needs
		to encode in UTF for all files in order for the code to work properly.	
======
2CH_TEST_NIBURAHTML.html
	This file is the expected HTML that the app should use for the board list WebView.
	This is used in the tests for comparison with the actual output.
